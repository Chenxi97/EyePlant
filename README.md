# EyePlant

### Introduction
EyePlant is a python game using OpenCV+Dlib+PyQt5. The main idea of this game was inspired by a childhood computer game, in which we can control characters to catch dropped items. In this game, we use eyes instead as a technical innovation point. I think it's an interesting experiment and I learned a lot from this project.

Hope you enjoy this game and have fun!

### How to run this game
Just run main.py. You may need to install some dependency libraries.
