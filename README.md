# EyePlant

### Introduction
EyePlant is a python game using OpenCV+Dlib+Qt. The main idea of this game was inspired by our childhood computer games, in which we can control characters to catch dropped items. In this game, we use eyes instead as a technical innovation point. I think it's an interesting experiment and I learned a lot from this project.

Hope you enjoy this game and have fun!

### How to run this game
Just run main.py. You may need to install some dependency libraries.
